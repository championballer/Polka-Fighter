# PolkaFighter
A web based game built in Javascript using Phaser.js

__Note: Launching index.html won't be enough. The game can be used using a local server based in google chrome using an extension by the name of Web Server for Chrome.To setup files on Web Server for Chrome extension, only the folder location on the machine needs to be marked. __

The final goal for this repository is to implement a reinforcement agent to play this game, and excel at it. This is expected to use concepts like QLearning, Convolutional Neural Networks among others, and that is where the fun actually lies.
